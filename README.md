# Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War Launcher
Launcher made in Python designed to launch *special* versions of Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare.

# Usage

1. Click and select the directory where your game is installed.
2. Choose between Modern Warfare or Black Ops Cold War and click 'Launch'.
3. Use the 'Download DLL' buttons to install better discord_game_sdk.dll files to the games.

# Features
- Can launch Modern Warfare or Black Ops Cold War
- Prompt you to install them if you don't have them
- Discord RPC
- Cold War menu shows what mission each of your campaign saves is on
- Download DLL buttons to install the best (in my opinion) discord_game_sdk.dll to your game files
- Plays the respective game's main theme in the background, and can be muted
- Launcher freezes when you launch a game so it won't use cpu power until you finish playing
- manage your default mw operators within the launcher (will only apply on first launch until you press delete user data is deleted or when you change the dll)
- Manage your default loadouts (same thing as operator editor applies)
- Download .cfgs
