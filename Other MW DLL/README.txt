This .dll goes to the root folder of your Modern Warfare installation.

This is not recommended because performance is severely degraded, saving doesnt work (unless you use the weapon or operator editor),
and you will encounter many bugs.

This isnt included in the launcher for these reasons so if you want to use it put it in the game yourself.
